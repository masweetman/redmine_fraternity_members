Bank Transactions for <%= @statement_date %>
----------------------------------------
The following transactions occurred during <%= @statement_date %>. Please verify that all transactions are accounted for as Deposits or Expenses. If there are any bounced checks or credit returns (from expired AGO checks), simply be reminded to settle those funds by securing payment or cutting new checks (and try to avoid them in the future by communicating with your chapter). For instructions on reporting Deposits and Expenses, see the Treasurer's Manual at members.ago.org.

These emails are sent every month to the Treasurer, President, and Chapter Advisor. You can view transactions at any time on the Financials tab of your chapter project. For a complete bank statement, log on to Chase Online Banking.

Each Deposit or Expense should be reported within 48 hours of the transaction.
